# edr-community-edition
This Community Edition is a free version of our EclecticIQ Endpoint Response solution for POC or other non-production uses. It leverages our enterprise-ready osquery-based agent to provide visibility into endpoint activities, query configuration management, a live query interface, and alerting capabilities based on security critical events. You will be redirected to the PolyLogyx GitHub repository for immediate access.
